 * SAGE - Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment
 *
 * Module: sdlSingleContext.h
 * Author : Byungil Jeong
 *
 *   Description:   This is the header file for the video display module of SAGE. 
 *
 *   Notes   :    Since the display window may receive its many pieces from many servers, we need to pass multiple buffers
 *         to this class. Each of the buffers passed contains a frame which forms a part (or whole) of the image on
 *         the display side.
