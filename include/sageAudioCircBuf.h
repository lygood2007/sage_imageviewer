/***************************************************************************************
 * SAGE - Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment
 *
 * Module:  sageAudioCircBuf.h
 * Author : Byungil Jeong, Hyejung Hur
 *
 *   Description: This is the header file for the circular buffer of sage pixel blocks
 *
 *   Notes   :   This class is supposed to provide the common buffers for holding
 *         the pixel blocks. It also takes care of the reading and writing of pixel blocks
 *         in a circular fashion. The member functions will be able to provide a complete
 *         interface to handling these buffers.
 *
 *         The algo is that the buffers are writen to and read from in the same direction
 *         [0 to n and then back to 0]
